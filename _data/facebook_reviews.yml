    Craig sorted out my slow running laptop quickly & at a very reasonable cost.
    Great to have someone local who will come to the house to deal with computer problems.
    I would certainly recommend Craig.

    I will go to Craig with any computer problems I have in the future.
    His friendly manner and explanation made me feel as though I wasn't a complete technoob.
    He solved the problems I had on my laptop in no time.
    If anyone has computer problems, I wouldn't look anywhere else than Craig Chamberlain - Computer Services.
    A very grateful Anita.

    How great to have Craig Chamberain IT Services in Sedbergh.
    I made use of his services recently and he promptly and efficiently got me sorted.
    He’s a lovely guy, extremely helpful and knowledgeable, and very patient with someone who is non tech savvy!
    He gives a first rate service, competitively priced and I thoroughly recommend him.
    I will be using his services in the future for all my computer issues.

    My computer was letting me down to the point I could not even put in my password.
    I saw an advert in our look around mag that Craig Chamberlain will come to your house,
    Craig came and soon had me sorted.  He is fully recommended
    and so pleasant, and very reasonable cost.  Thanks Craig.

    Got my laptop working as it should do - after 18 months of it not doing so!
    Friendly and efficient service. He clearly knows what he is doing and gives unbiased advice.
    I have no hesitation in recommending him.

    Craig changed my website hosting over following a price increase from my previous host.
    He was really efficient and provided great service.
    We have also had a laptop fixed by Craig again we were really happy with the results.
    I would thoroughly recommend Craig
