If you have files stored just on your device or perhaps on old disks and pen drives, perhaps in a drawer or cupboard, you may be in danger of losing them.  

There are several great cloud storage systems that allow you to affordably keep a copy of your files in a secure location on the internet.  You can then access your files and photos from several devices.  Furthermore you will be less tied to a particular laptop that could suffer a corrupted drive or even be lost or stolen.
