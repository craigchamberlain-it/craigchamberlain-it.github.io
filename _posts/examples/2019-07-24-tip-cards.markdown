__Problem:__ You, and/or your staff, could save a lot of time on a computer using keyboard shortcuts.  Not everyone knows about them and there are the additional problems of having the confidence to try and remembering the key combinations.  

__Solution:__ I have created a set of flash cards for both Mac and Windows users that can be delivered via an automated mail system or integration with services such as MailChimp or social media.  As a basic package, the cards are available for free.  However they contain a discrete reference to my company and are in my company colours.  For customers, I can rebrand the cards to your specification and indeed produce further ranges.    

__Result:__ The cards encourage experimentation and build confidence by calling on the recipient to try a keyboard shortcut.  By delivering just one at a time, they do not overwhelm the person attempting to remember new shortcuts.  Using these cards you, and/or your staff, could increase productivity and IT confidence.
