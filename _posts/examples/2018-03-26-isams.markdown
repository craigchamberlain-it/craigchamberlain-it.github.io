__Problem:__ Extracting information from one proprietary system and inputting to another can be a tedious and error prone process.  

__Solution:__ When working at a school, I created a set of tools to query our school database (iSAMS MIS) and cross check this against Active Directory using Microsoft's excellent AD tools for PowerShell.  

__Result:__ This slashed the time taken to provision new accounts by days while increasing data consistency meaning students and teachers got the notifications and permissions they needed far more reliably.
