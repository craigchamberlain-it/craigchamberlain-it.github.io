description: Footloose Travel specialise in wildlife and safari holidays.  They run a series of talks followed up by a quite technical quizzes with a prize trip for the winner.  This campaign was designed to engage people with a real interest in learning about wildlife, by feeding interesting facts that would relate to a clue in the quiz.  This had good engagement on Facebook and was also very successfully complemented with a printed version which was displayed in the Footloose shop window and throughout the town.
