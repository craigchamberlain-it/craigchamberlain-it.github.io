    text: Craig has been extremely helpful in setting up a new website for us and reformatting our email system.  The customer feedback has been good and we are very pleased with it.  Subsequent enquiries and tweaks have been dealt with very rapidly.

The Sedbergh Lookaround is a community newsletter in the Sedbergh area, run for the community good.  It is primarily distributed in print but various information and the back catalogue are available online.  

I modernised an existing site and provided a content management system so the editors can add new editions to the back catalogue.

I also set up email for the domain with Googles G-Suite.
